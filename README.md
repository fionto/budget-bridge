# BudgetBridge

## Overview
This project is a personal journey into **Data Ownership** and **Python development**. 

For years, I have tracked my financial life using the *Wallet by Budgetbakers* app. While the platform is excellent, I believe that personal financial history is a sensitive asset that should be managed independently.

The goal of this project is to build a custom **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline to reclaim my data from the CSV exports provided by the platform. By processing these records myself, I am learning to organize, analyze, and visualize my financial history exactly how I want it.

## Project Vision
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Develop a robust Python tool to parse and normalize historical CSV data.
* **Phase 2:** Create custom dashboards and analytics that go beyond the app's standard reports.
* **Long-term Goal:** Transition toward a fully self-managed financial tracking system, reducing reliance on third-party platforms.

## Technical Approach
As I am currently honing my Python skills, this project focuses on:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Modeling transactions and accounts as Python classes.
- **Data Cleansing:** Handling "dirty" input and normalizing currencies/dates.
- **Privacy First:** Building a local-first architecture to ensure financial data remains under my control.
